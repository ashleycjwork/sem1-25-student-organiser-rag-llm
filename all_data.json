Balancing what the student wants to do and benefiting WEHI is a great example of a fantastic project. The key continuous improvement skills that are tested and improved apon during this program are: Tolerance for Complexity Tolerance for Ambiguity Critical Thinking Adaptability Learnability Collaborative by Default It is important for students to understand the high-level concepts of the domain the student is working in. This increases the independence of the student to work through complexity. Students need to recognise the limited time they have and what they can achieve. This is why documentation is key to ensure information is passed to future students. The ability to learn quickly by doing your own research is important. Finding out how fast you learn and where your limits are, in a safe space, can help you to know yourself better. To get a better understanding of the internship, I provide a RCP student handbook . There are multiple internships running at the same time. We encourage students to collaborate within projects and across sister projects (similar projects) via co-working meetings.",

The process is as follows: I send an email to acknowledge their submission has been seen . If the application is not taken forward I email the  unsuccessful students as soon as possible.  If the application is taken forward I reach out to them for a short discussion. At that short discussion I explain to them the projects that might interest them and where I see that they could contribute. I explain the challenges and whether something is difficult or easy. I ask them to think about what they want. I also share with them the link to the project page so that they can see more options. This might take 15 minutes per student and takes up a lot of time, but I think it is worth it to make sure I understand them. Once they agree to a project that they want to do and that I can allocate them to, I will email them with an offer. At this point they can accept or refuse this offer.",

        "title": "During the project",
        "content": "During the project I ask students to meet a minimum of three times a week. One meeting is to meet as a team with the supervisor to understand the high-level concepts and the architectural or algorithmic limitations, another meeting is a co-working meeting with their fellow project members without the supervisor, and another meeting is a co-working meeting with \u201csister project\u201d team members to help share information across projects. I ask the students to understand the basic concepts before they choose how they would like to improve the project. So, if they want to create a web application, they can, if it contributes to solving the broader problem. In that way, we are asking them to self-direct their project to something that is interesting to them and helps build the skills they want. I have changed the way I have setup the student projects so that now students are in groups of three or more. There have been times when I have not been able to make that happen, but that is the standard as of Summer 2023/2024. You can see the key milestones and the onboarding emails we send at regular intervals during the internship . Most projects are building on the previous set of students work as they are complicated and it can take a long time for average students to grasp new domain information. These average students want to be spoon-fed, which is a major criticism that businesses have of new graduates.",

This is also a critical skill for their future careers for project handovers and maintenance work, which many students do not have experience with. As discussed earlier, the students and look at the wiki that shows what the previous students have done, and I also talk to them over the phone about the work of the previous students. This should not be a surprise to applicants that they are working on a project developed by previous interns. They can refuse the offer of the project if they find the project not to their liking. The current intake of the Genomics Metadata Multiplexing project is an example of an ongoing project that is working extremely well due to the foundational work done by previous students.

        "content": "Other Interactions I also have scheduled a voluntary follow-up session / networking session between students on Thursday across the entire student intake but have stopped these due to lack of uptake by the students. By the third week no-one attends, and I am left to myself. I also have added to the handbook and onboarding checklist the monthly in-person Research Software Engineer (RSE) lunches that I organise and attend but again, the uptake has been low. Roughly, less than 5% of students attend a lunch and none attend consistently. Last intake, I asked a group of students to liaise with another group on a project. I asked multiple times but this was not actioned. This intake, I did ask for more structure where a scheduled meeting with a sister project needed to be set and this has increased the communication between groups. In the projects where there is a need for a Subject Matter Expert (SME), I have been trialling to catchup with the SME at the 5-week mark for a Q and A. This allows the students to understand the information in the wiki and some basic terms and models of the domain so that they can make the most out of the SME\u2019s time and answers. This has been a good working model so far. I go into the office once a month, mainly for the RSE lunches. I have worked at WEHI for over 3 years now and have had an in-person meeting with my supervisor once. I am basically a remote worker. So, to increase the opportunity of in-person meetups, I have tried to get students to meet me in-person as part of the RSE lunches, but there has been little uptake. I tried to organise an in-person tour of the WEHI building last year after some questions from students, but no students responded to the email. There used to be a weekly tour of the WEHI building but this been cancelled since the pandemic. I also emailed students about an in-person student intern conference that WEHI runs every year where they could present and meet fellow student interns, but no one responded. To ensure students are aware that this is 100% remote I have updated the website and I have amended the application form to now ask them to confirm that they know that this is a 100% remote internship as appears below: I recognise that this is a 100% remote role and that all meetings and interactions will be virtual. I also recognise that there are opportunities for in-person events like the monthly Parkville Research Software Engineer lunch.",

These tags are read out via next generation sequencing and help to study important questions in biology like cancer evolution or embryonic development. Given that both the technology and the data it generates are new, no software is currently available that would facilitate the analysis, especially for experimental researchers less familiar with programming and computation.

        "content": "Introduction Post-sequencing quality control (QC) is an important step in ensuring that the quality of sequencing data meets expectations. Multiple tools exist to evaluate sequencing quality, such as FastQC[1], Fastq Screen[2] and Qualimap[3]. Core sequencing facilities, such as WEHI Genomics, process hundreds of sequencing runs every year. In order to troubleshoot sequencing issues and provide assurance of data quality to collaborators, sequencing facilities must implement robust data management workflows to ensure that QC data processing is automated where possible, is easily accessible and is appropriately archived for posterity. Given a large volume of runs, there exists the possibility of inter-run QC comparisons to better gauge run quality. MultiQC[4] is a software tool that collates and displays QC information from numerous supported bioinformatics tools. MultiQC operates on a per-run basis, however, MegaQC[5] collates the data from these reports for comparison. However, MegaQC has not been in active development since 2020 and is considered \u201cpretty unstable\u201d by the developers. Additionally, the software lacks functionality that lists extensive project metadata, so that experiments can be more easily tracked and MultiQC reports can be easily located. Lastly, the tool lacks easy exporting of data, so that analyses can be further analysed programmatically. Given that MegaQC overlaps with many of our use cases, it may be possible to modify and/or extend the software for our use cases. Alternatively, Shiny apps (shiny.rstudio.com) allow for interactive data analysis and provide an ideal platform for QC data collation. Integration with Monday.com and LabArchives used by the Genomics lab may also be of benefit for retrieving and/or depositing QC data and project metadata.

It plays a critical role in helping researchers by providing an extensive and comprehensive ecosystem of software tools, packages, and resources tailored specifically for the analysis and interpretation of high-throughput biological data. Visualizations, especially visualizations of dimension reductions, are the workhorse of all scRNA-seq data analyses. They are hugely important during all stages of analysis, from exploring to presenting results. They often shape analysis decisions, like which batch correction approach to use, and can point to novel discoveries, like novel cell type marker genes or even new cell types. Unfortunately, currently employed visualization strategies struggle with the scale and sparsity of scRNA-seq data, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Overplotting is not a new problem and it has plagued many different fields, many of which have come up with unique solutions. Here, we suggest the use of hexagonal binning (Carr, 1990; Carr et al., 1987) for dimension reduction representations of scRNA-seq data. In order to make hexagonal plotting readily available to the scientific community, we developed schex (single-cell hexagonal plotting), an R package that allows users to produce hexagonal binning representations for dimension reductions of scRNA-seq. However, maintaining research software and making it easy to use can be difficult for researchers in the long run. This project is to aim at finding out which areas of software maintenance can possibly abstracted away from the researcher and into the hands of a Research Software Engineer (RSE).",

Data integration enables identification of specific biological relationships between these features (e.g. genes and proteins), to create new insights into molecular processes involved in health and disease. MixOmics includes 19 data integration methods, amongst which 13 were developed in our lab. These methods are all based on dimension reduction using Projection to Latent Structures (PLS). Our users include computational biologists, molecular biologists and bioinformaticians who wish to integrate their data and identify signatures of genes, proteins etc. to explain or predict a disease outcome. The package (ranked in the top 5% package in Bioconductor) is easy to use because all methods use the same underlying PLS principles and produce numerous graphics for interpretation (Fig. 1).

This is a type of metadata. While this allows the sequencing facility to save money by processing samples in bulk, the ability to keep track of these multiplexes is complicated. This is especially significant because there is no resourcing to provide an assistant to be able to check the quality all the metadata at the time of multiplexing.

        "content": "Introduction Our cells contain a vast array of interacting organelles (tiny structures within cells that perform specific tasks, similar to the parts of a machine) that determine cellular processes through both health and disease. These structures may be imaged using electron microscopy by bouncing electrons off heavy-metal stained membranes. The resulting images have a resolution of nanometers per voxel (the 3D equivalent of an image pixel) in 3D and each data set may contain millions or billions of voxels per cell. [1] In a paper from 2021 [2] a new method for processing images from the focused ion beam-scanning EM (FIB-SEM) was used to image the cellular ultrastructure of phagophore-ER contacts in three dimensions. As per the paper: FIB-SEM is ideally suited for the acquisition of 3D ultrastructural images from large cellular volumes (Hoffman et al., 2020). However, traditional methods for the reconstruction and analysis of such data require manual image segmentation and classification. The hand-drawn surfaces that are generated during manual segmentation are laborious to produce, low throughput, and subject to human imprecision, making them unsuitable for large-scale morphometric analyses. To overcome these limitations, we developed an approach that delegates the most time-consuming tasks to an artificial intelligence (AI) within a framework that captures the true surface detail of intracellular organelles. Using the machine learning capabilities of Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) in combination with ImageJ (Arganda-Carreras et al., 2017; Frank et al., 2004; Schindelin et al., 2012), we trained a random forest computer vision model to faithfully detect all cellular membranes in volumetric FIB-SEM data (Figures 6A and 6B). We have termed this 3D framework AIVE (AI-directed voxel extraction; workflow outlined in Figure S7). The project would involve a series of stages to bring the software infrastructure to a level that will help with development. The initial stage would involve the setup of the workflow along with testing and improving the documentation of the workflow on a local laptop. The potential second stage would be to aim to run the workflow in the WEHI HPC environment known as Milton. The potential third stage would be to add more data to test the workflow to ensure that the test coverage is broader than it is currently. Once this third stage is achieved, there will be an opportunity to work on streamlining the AIVE workflow.

AIVE Student Project Interns:  Si Yang (Sean) Chen, Chun-Tung (Chloe) Tsai, Jiawen Deng High-Level Domain work During the first 4-5 weeks, we learned about and tried to understand the AIVE workflow for converting 2D cell image stacks into 3D models and familiarised ourselves with software tools used in the workflow such as ImageJ, MIB and WEKA. Our in-depth understanding was presented in the whiteboard presentation, which detailed key stages in AIVE\u2019s workflow. The team also developed high-level flowcharts showing the entire process and the interconnected stages. Subsequently, we decided to work on the organelle segmentation stage. We converted two ImageJ macros (macros 1 and 1b) from ImageJ Macro Language into Python code for better reproducibility. Building on the public wiki created by previous interns, we added technical documentation and additional notes for both our and previous features, including detailed explanations and flowcharts, to help future interns and people without prior knowledge understand AIVE more easily.    Architecture / Algorithm work  Macro 1:              Macro 1b:  \nTechnical work Macro 1: Image stack is loaded into program and all unique pixel values in entire stack are computed. These pixel values are used as thresholds, which are applied to each image slice in stack to create stacks of binary masks. The mask stack is saved and this is repeated for each threshold.  Macro 1b: The process starts by selecting the input image file (HeLa.tiff) and specifying the output directory. A Gaussian blur is then applied with an XYZ radius of X = 3, Y = 3, and Z = 1, chosen to account for the anisotropic voxel dimensions (3 nm in X and Y, 10 nm in Z). These values ensure consistent blurring across the real-world voxel sizes. Users may need to adjust blur parameters or consider kernel size for different datasets. The macro then processes the entire image stack, saving the results in new stacks.

We aimed to upload as much of the Simulacrum V2 data as we could to REDCap, which shaped how we cleaned our dataset. We also wanted to see if we would break REDCap with the new, larger dataset.   Security Aspect: x  Architecture / Algorithm work  The structure of this project is demonstrated by the following flow chart:  REDCap / Simulacrum Aspect:  1. Cleaned Simulacrum V2 data a. Fixed column names (lowercased all field variable names and added underscores due to REDCap guidelines for field names) b. Identified invalid records \u2022 Assumed \u2018gender_patient\u2019 was based on sex assigned at birth ->  records of female patients with prostate cancer & male patients with gynaecological cancer \u2022 Records where treatment (radiotherapy and chemotherapy /hormonal therapy) occurs after death of patient \u2022 Patients that died before treatment / diagnosis \u2022 Treatments that occurred before tumour diagnosis c. Removed invalid records across the different tables  2. Defined a data dictionary for REDCap a. Defined the instruments: Av Patient, Av Tumour, Av Gene, Sact Regimen Outcome, Sact Cycle, Sact Drug, Rtds (each is a separate table) b. Defined repeating instruments (number of treatments and tumours varied across the patients) c. Defined valid field value types for certain field variables (e.g. \u2018gleason_combined\u2019 in av_tumour defined to only take type \u2018integer\u2019)  3. Uploaded onto REDCap through the API a. Obtained REDCap API token b. Obtained importing function from previous intake\u2019s git c. Uploaded tables via the API  Security Aspect:  Technical work REDCap / Simulacrum Aspect:  Python was the main programming language that we used. We conducted data preprocessing on the Simulacrum dataset by removing records that are not accurately reflected in the real world (e.g. female patients with prostate cancer, treatments that occurred after death). We also ensured consistent schema for the dataset in order to adhere with the data dictionary defined in REDCap. We had to define repeating instruments in REDCap due to the varying nature of number of treatments or tumours per patient. Finally, we uploaded (to the best of our abilities) the cleaned datasets onto REDCap using the API. However, due to complications caused by uploading via the API we were only able to upload the av tables and some of the sact_outcome_regimen merged table that we created after cleaning the data. Hence, we broke REDCap and it presents the question: \u201cis REDCap the best way to store this information?\u201d. Also, Simulacrum does NOT include location-specific data (the closest is the type of place a patient died, e.g. a hospital or hospice), so a new visualisation dashboard might need to be made if that\u2019s the aim of a future intake.   Security Aspect: We created a Django application to act as an authentication wrapper around an Rshiny app. Thus access is controlled by Django\u2019s authentication layer and users log in via SSO, which we paired Django with mozilla-django-oidc to accomplish. Currently our SSO server is auth0 but the aim is to move to AAF. We have set up the application such that all that would be needed to move to AAF would be to set the environment variables for server address & security key once AAF provides those, as well as doign any configurations that AAF require on their end. The authorisation is achieved by Django creating user sessions with the \u2018users\u2019 from SSO stored in a PostgresSQL database.  Testing was done locally but the application is packaged in docker and can easily be deployed to a correctly configured nectar server that opens the relevant ports.  Currently the embedded application is   Key Links \u2022 Our final presentation \u2022 Our Github repository \u2022 Our technical diary                   BioNix Student Project Interns: Cat Tuong Anh Nguyen, Di Wu, Liam Mclnerney High-Level Domain work During the first few weeks of the project, we learned about the Nix ecosystem and the required bioinformatics knowledge for the software that we are going to wrap into BioNix. In particular, terms like metagenomics or taxonomic classification for Kraken2, or tandem repeats for TRF. All our knowledges are then presented in a meeting on a whiteboard for our supervisors to correct any false interpretation.  The research is then compiled by us to be added into the existing BioNix wiki by WEHI, including any modifications so that the page is more coherent and user-friendly. We added a project introduction page, added some more questions to the FAQ, and had a scan through the existing information to make sure they are non-repetitive, correct, coherent, uniform and change them if necessary Architecture / Algorithm work  We had help from our instructor to visualize what an expression to wrap our software would look like, combined with our learning from both the existing package-base, and our personal research. We understood the basic structure of the expression, and how Kraken2 would require no configuration, because all the configs are already in the GitHub repository, or how TRF require thorough management of its dependencies.  In addition, we understood the contribution steps for nixpkgs and ensure that our expressions abide by the rules. Technical work \u2022 Finalized the expression of wrapping TRF to BioNix. \u2022 Made prototypes of expressions to wrap Kraken2. \u2022 Wrote and tested the prototype expressions for Kraken2.

In the second intake, the team focused on two key areas. First, a dynamic HTML page was developed to update key dates on the main website, RSEAA.org.au, enhancing user experience. Second, the team focused on creating a platform that drew inspiration from a popular live polling application called CrowdPurr. Within this polling project, the team was divided among two sub-projects: One focused on extending Claper, an existing open-source live polling tool, while the other group built a custom live polling application from the ground up using React.

It has four main components, the front end, the backend, the database and the virtual machine (Nectar). As the Data Registry subgroup, we addressed the frontend, backend and VM as the main areas of work. The frontend involved the creation of different components such as the Projects components which linked to the Patients and Datasets components (Figure 1).  Architecture / Algorithm work   Figure 1.

The data registry is a web application which was concurrently developed by the Data Commons Data registry team. Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the system, preventing unauthorized access and data misuse. This protection is critical because it safeguards not only WEHI's research interests but also the privacy rights of patients whose medical data is being managed.  The choice of authentication protocols had to align with industry standards and requirements to ensure compliance with security and privacy regulations while supporting Single Sign-On (SSO) for ease of access.  High level work consisted of:  - Researching what resources were available and suitable for this project. - Understanding how different authentication protocols worked, and the advantages/disadvantages of each. - Identifying the requirements of the authentication system. This work resulted in making the following decisions: - OpenID Connect (OIDC) was selected as the primary authentication protocol due to its suitability for research organizations, as recommended by the Australian Access Federation (AAF). OIDC supports both SSO and social login, offers flexibility in integrating different identity providers, and is simpler to implement compared to alternatives like SAML.  - Keycloak, an open-source identity and access management system, was chosen to run on the authentication server. It offers ease of setup, sufficient security for non-critical use cases, and eliminates the licensing costs associated with platforms like Auth0. Keycloak also allows integration with AAF as an identity provider, leveraging OIDC to provide seamless access for Australian researchers. Architecture / Algorithm work  The following diagram depicts the typical authentication sequence for a user signing into the data registry using their Okta credentials:  Technical work Luke: - Researched OIDC and authentication tools. - Discovered, installed and configured Keycloak - Implemented OIDC authentication flow with demo Python script and keycloak. Trung: - Deployed Keycloak with test web application to implement the OIDC authentication protocol.  - Modified Keycloak realm to accept Auth0 as an Identity Provider. - Created and performed authentication demo in final presentation.

Key Links \u2022  Haemosphere Student Project Interns: Michele Meliala, Lady Feren Pangjaya, Thanh Pham, Thi Hong Minh Dao, Zachary Iskandar  High-Level Domain work Our group\u2019s work was the continuation of the ongoing migration of Haemosphere from Python 2 to Python 3, due to Python 2 no longer being supported. We mainly focused on improving overall speed on the site, and improving the scalability of the site to accommodate multiple simultaneous users without crashing. After extensive testing, we determined that a caching-related approach was the best solution for performance enhancement. In addition, we made minor improvements to the existing tutorials and documentation, so that hopefully future intakes will have a smoother and less confusing onboarding experience.  We implore future intakes to explore this caching solution in greater depth to assess its feasibility, and to debug some datasets such as Schultze and Immgen to make them compatible with the new Python 3 framework, as well as any other necessary improvements to the site to further enhance the user experience. In the longer term, we also recommend Haemosphere to be migrated to a supported version of Python, as support for the destination version (Python 3.6) ceased in December 2021, almost three years ago at the time of writing.  Architecture / Algorithm work We trialled several different solutions and measured the impact each solution had on improving speed and performance. These included increasing the RAM of the virtual machine, pre-loading data onto RAM cache and utilising disk cache. Through performance testing, we found that a large memory virtual machine with caching was the most efficient in terms of speed and reliability. We also explored changing file formats using .h5 and .parquet, but this method was overcomplicated and only yielded minimal improvements compared to other methods.   Technical work Fixed minor bugs that prevented us from running the server (typos, missing dependencies during the onboarding process, tweaks to config files) Took the opportunity to explore the option of a higher memory VM after the hosting arrangement with the University for the publicly accessible version of Haemosphere was changed Conducted performance testing on various differential expression datasets to assess performance and detect errors for future intakes to fix, as well as to compare different server configurations Implemented RAM and disk caching, which significantly improved performance   Key Links \u2022 Haemosphere website \u2022 Public Github repository \u2022 Sharepoint \u2022 YouTube link for presentation (add link when uploaded)   Student Organizer Student Project  Interns: Jiaman(Mandy) Xu, Xiaoqing(Betty) Hu, Yiyang Chen, Yovela Budiman High-Level Domain work The team analyzed the web app's code, setting short, mid, and long-term goals. Short-term tasks, like improving the navigation bar, creating filtered student lists, and updating the public data schema and database, were completed. Mid-term goals, such as linking project and intake pages and refining the UI, are underway. Long-term goals, including database optimization and platform migration, are set for future interns. Documentation in the project wiki and SQL scripts ensure smooth handovers for upcoming cohorts. Architecture / Algorithm work  The project uses a modular architecture, making it easy to test and integrate new features. A responsive navigation bar adapts to different screen sizes, with dropdowns for better organization. Key features include dynamic student lists, email copy functionality, and direct links between project, intake pages, and filtered student lists, streamlining navigation. Technical work \u2022 Frontend (UI/UX): o Designed a responsive navigation bar using HTML and CSS for seamless navigation across devices, incorporating dropdown menus for different sections. o Developed subpages for student lists (current, future, past, all students) and added buttons linking intake and project pages with pre-filtered data. \u2022 Backend (Database & Functionality): o Generated fake test data and updated database schemas accordingly. o Created upgrade_database.sql to document and maintain database changes for future students. \u2022 Testing & Integration: o Tested the system using Nectar VM to simulate real-world user behavior and ensure smooth functionality.

We\ndid this to leverage the experience we have in\nthe RCP of working with student software\ninterns by collaborating with labs. \nBecause this is unpaid, we aim to get students  \nvia the official programs at the University of\nMelbourne so they can obtain course credit.\nThis program allows us to share our\nknowledge and experiences with the students\nto help them to build their confidence so thatthey know that they have the skills and\ninitiative to handle future situations.\nThere are three intakes during the year,\nSemester 1, Semester 2, and Summer.\nWe aim to share the information from our\ncurrent student interns to our future student\ninterns. We do this by getting our current\nstudents to document the nuances of the\nproject and the challenges that they faced. \nWe are constantly trying to improve the\nexperience for our students and always\nappreciate feedback.\nWhile our most consistent feedback is to have  \nan in-person work environment, we are only\nproviding 100% online work environments.\nWEHI RCP  Student Handbook | 3Students at RSE Parkville lunch that happens on the second Thursday of each month.Proactive\nProactiveProactive\nProactive\nConcept-first approach\nIt is important for students to\nunderstand the high-level concepts of\nthe domain the student is working in.\nThis increases the independence of\nthe student to work through complexity.\nTest your limits\nThe ability to learn quickly by doing\nyour own research is important.\nFinding out how fast you learn and\nwhere your limits are, in a safe space,\ncan help you to know yourself better.Philosophy\nDocumentation is Key\nStudents need to recognise the limited\ntime they have and what they can\nachieve. This is why documentation is\nkey to ensure information is passed to\nfuture students.\nCollaboration is vital\nThere are multiple internships running\nat the same time. We encourage\nstudents to collaborate within projects\nand across sister projects (similar\nprojects) via co-working meetings.\nWEHI RCP  Student Handbook | 4Benefits for Students\nThere are many benefits for student interns in\nthis program to help them progress in their\ncareers by giving them opportunities to grow\nand learn in a safe environment and achieve\ntheir potential, which builds confidence.\nMany students start the program having some\nlevel of technical skills, but very little\nunderstanding of how important it is to know\nthe nuances and concepts of the work\nenvironment and domain knowledge.\nThis is why we give them the time to research\nthe concepts and give them feedback on how\nto refine those concepts.\nStudent interns are provided with honest\nfeedback to show where their skills and\nabilities place them, what kind of organisation\nthey might be a good fit with, and how they\ncan improve during and after the internship.Students also get the opportunity to learn real-\nworld skills such as keeping meeting notes,\ndocumentation, learning how to communicate,\nand giving presentations. \nStudents also get the opportunity to deal with\nrealistic data and real world problems, where\nthe answers and the technical solution is not\nso clear as in their coursework.\nStudents are encouraged to self-direct during\nthe internship. Balancing what the student\nwants to do and benefiting WEHI is a great\nexample of a fantastic project.\nAll in all, students have the opportunity to\nleave the internship with an improved sense of\nconfidence that they have the ability to handle\nnew environments and domains, even if they\nhaven't worked in that area before. This is the\nbest outcome we can hope for as supervisors.\nWEHI RCP  Student Handbook | 5\nTop L-R: Youran Zhou, Marika Benetti-Hille.

This is a snippet of the\nfull Code of Conduct on the website.\nThis community is made up of a diverse\nmixture of researchers, research software\nengineers, professionals and students.\nDiversity is what we are hoping to improve our\ncommunities and workplaces, but it can also\nlead to communication issues and\nunhappiness. \nTo that end, we have a few ground rules that\nwe ask people to adhere to. This code applies\nequally to founders, mentors and those\nseeking help and guidance.\nThis isn\u2019t an exhaustive list of things that you\ncan\u2019t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which\nit\u2019s intended -a guide to make it easier to\nenrich all of us and the technical communities\nin which we participate.\nThis code of conduct applies to all spaces\nmanaged by the group. This includes chat\nrooms, the mailing lists, events, and any other\nforums created by the platform which the\ncommunity uses for communication. \nIn addition, violations of this code outside\nthese spaces may affect a person's ability to\nparticipate within them. If you believe\nsomeone is violating the code of conduct,\nplease let us know.\nThe key points are:\nBe friendly and patient.\nBe welcoming.\nBe considerate.\nBe respectful.\nBe careful with the words you choose.We strive to be a community that welcomes\nand supports people of all backgrounds and\nidentities. This includes, but is not limited to\nmembers of any race, ethnicity, culture,\nnational origin, colour, immigration status,\nsocial and economic class, educational level,\nsex, sexual orientation, gender identity and\nexpression, age, size, family status, political\nbelief, religion, and mental and physical ability.\nYour work will be used by other people, and\nyou in turn will depend on the work of others.\nAny decision you take will affect users and\ncolleagues, and you should take those\nconsequences into account when making\ndecisions. Remember that we\u2019re a diverse\ncommunity, so you might not be\ncommunicating in someone else\u2019s primary\nlanguage.\nNot all of us will agree all the time, but\ndisagreement is no excuse for poor behavior\nand poor manners. We might all experience\nsome frustration now and then, but we cannot\nallow that frustration to turn into a personal\nattack. It\u2019s important to remember that a\ncommunity where people feel uncomfortable\nor threatened is not a productive one.\nMembers of the community should be\nrespectful when dealing with other members\nas well as with people outside the community.\nWhen we disagree, try to understand why.\nDisagreements, both social and technical,\nhappen all the time and we are no exception. It\nis important that we resolve disagreements\nand differing views constructively. Remember\nthat we\u2019re different. The strength of this\ncommunity comes from its diversity. Different\npeople have different perspectives on issues.\nBeing unable to understand why someone\nholds a viewpoint doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re\nwrong. \nWEHI RCP  Student Handbook | 7Want to know more?\nAll the information on this page is on the\nwebsite\u2019s main student page via the QR code\ndown below.\nFAQ\nThere is a FAQ on the website under \u201cKey\nDocuments to review and FAQ\u201d.\nThis FAQ provides information on:\nApplying for the internship program,\nOnboarding onto the program,\nWhat is expected at meetings, and\nWhat is expected when you finish.\nKey Milestones and Emails\nThe Key Milestones and Emails page can be\nfound under \u201cKey Documents to review and\nFAQ\u201d.\nAt the bottom fo the Key Milestones and\nEmails page you can find the onboarding\nemails that are sent out throughout the intake\nto remind students of the expectations of the\nprogram.\nLearn real world skills\nWe prepare students for the real-world by\nteaching them:\nhow understanding the domain problem\nand the users is more important than\ntechnical skills, and how to work on a\ncomplex, ambiguous project,\nshowing them how to become as\nindependent as possible,\nshow them how to document and share\nknowledge to others in a professional\nmanner,\nexplain how a software maturity model can\nhelp clarify expectations, and\nteaching them how to work productively in\na remote environment.We even tell students how to try to avoid the\ntop 5 mistakes that students make.\nAvailable Projects\nThere is a list of available projects under the\ntitle \u201cList of student intern projects\u201d.\nThese projects change from intake to intake,\nso please reach out if you are unsure via\nemail:  mosbergen [dot] r [at] wehi [dot] edu\n[dot] au.\nHow to Apply\nWe suggest that you write a 1 page cover\nletter introducing yourself, along with your\nresume. You can find more details under \u201cHow\nto Apply\u201d.\nThis is a popular program as we can get over\n60 applications per intake for only 30 student\nplaces. This is why it can be challenging to\naccomodate all students. We do try our best to\nprovide feedback but this is limited due to the\nnumbers involved.\nWEHI RCP  Student Handbook | 8Research\nComputing\nPlatform",
