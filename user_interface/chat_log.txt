what to put in technical diary

ðŸ¤– Response:
Answer:
 In your technical diary within Sharepoint (e.g., WEHI-wide student intern group), include:

1. Technical notes folder for project intake with details of what you did to get results and sensitive data placement information.
2. URLs of documents, videos, or resources read/watched along with summaries.
3. Commandline commands used in setting up software (e.g., pip install pandas).
4. Technical errors encountered and resolutions.
5. General technical notes that took time to figure out for future students' benefit.
6. Technical help received from others, ensuring private information is not shared publicly without proper authorization.

Sure! Here's an updated version of your Technical notes folder with more detailed technical knowledge and helpful tips:

1. URLs of any documents you read or videos you watched, along with a quick summary of those documents to make it easy for others to decide if these documents or videos are worth reading/watching.

2. Commandline commands you used to setup your software system (e.g., pip install pandas) and how you fixed them.

3. General technical notes that took you some time to figure out that might help a future student, such as troubleshooting common issues or explaining the process of fixing them.

4. Specific technical help you received from other students, mentors, or supervisors (e.g., how they helped you with a project or provided guidance during a lab session).

5. Any helpful tips or tricks you learned along the way that might be useful for future students.

6. Technical knowledge to put into your technical diairy in Sharepoint (among others) that includes: URLs of any documents you read or videos you watched, along with a quick summary of those documents to make it easy for others to decide if these documents or videos are worth reading/watching.

Answer:
To add tech diairy to your daily routine, you can try incorporating these tips:

1. Start with a small amount: If you're new to taking supplements or using tech diairy, start with a small amount and gradually increase as you become more comfortable.

2. Choose the right product: Look for a tech diairy that is formulated specifically for menopause or other hormonal changes. Some brands offer options for different stages of life, such as "premenopause" or "perimenopause."

3. Consistency is key: Make sure to take your tech diairy at the same time each day, even if you're not feeling particularly hungry. This will help ensure that your body gets the necessary nutrients and support it needs during this important time in your life.

4. Don't forget about hydration: Drinking plenty of water is crucial for maintaining healthy hormones and supporting overall wellness. Make sure to drink at least 8-10 cups of water each day, even if you're not feeling thirsty.

5. Be patient with yourself: Remember that taking tech diairy is a journey, and it may take some time for your body to adjust to these new habits. Be kind to yourself and don't worry too much about what others are doing or saying.

6. Don't forget the benefits of hormonal balance: While taking tech diairy can help support hormonal balance, it's also important to focus on other aspects of your health and wellness, such as eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, and engaging in regular exercise.

Remember, taking tech diairy is just one part of a larger picture of overall health and wellness. By incorporating these tips into your daily routine, you can help support your body's natural hormonal changes and maintain optimal health during this important time in your life.
