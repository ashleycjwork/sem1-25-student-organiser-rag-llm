Balancing what the student wants to do and benefiting WEHI is a great example of a fantastic project. The key continuous improvement skills that are tested and improved apon during this program are: Tolerance for Complexity Tolerance for Ambiguity Critical Thinking Adaptability Learnability Collaborative by Default It is important for students to understand the high-level concepts of the domain the student is working in. This increases the independence of the student to work through complexity. Students need to recognise the limited time they have and what they can achieve. This is why documentation is key to ensure information is passed to future students. The ability to learn quickly by doing your own research is important. Finding out how fast you learn and where your limits are, in a safe space, can help you to know yourself better. To get a better understanding of the internship, I provide a RCP student handbook . There are multiple internships running at the same time. We encourage students to collaborate within projects and across sister projects (similar projects) via co-working meetings.",

The process is as follows: I send an email to acknowledge their submission has been seen . If the application is not taken forward I email the  unsuccessful students as soon as possible.  If the application is taken forward I reach out to them for a short discussion. At that short discussion I explain to them the projects that might interest them and where I see that they could contribute. I explain the challenges and whether something is difficult or easy. I ask them to think about what they want. I also share with them the link to the project page so that they can see more options. This might take 15 minutes per student and takes up a lot of time, but I think it is worth it to make sure I understand them. Once they agree to a project that they want to do and that I can allocate them to, I will email them with an offer. At this point they can accept or refuse this offer.",

        "title": "During the project",
        "content": "During the project I ask students to meet a minimum of three times a week. One meeting is to meet as a team with the supervisor to understand the high-level concepts and the architectural or algorithmic limitations, another meeting is a co-working meeting with their fellow project members without the supervisor, and another meeting is a co-working meeting with \u201csister project\u201d team members to help share information across projects. I ask the students to understand the basic concepts before they choose how they would like to improve the project. So, if they want to create a web application, they can, if it contributes to solving the broader problem. In that way, we are asking them to self-direct their project to something that is interesting to them and helps build the skills they want. I have changed the way I have setup the student projects so that now students are in groups of three or more. There have been times when I have not been able to make that happen, but that is the standard as of Summer 2023/2024. You can see the key milestones and the onboarding emails we send at regular intervals during the internship . Most projects are building on the previous set of students work as they are complicated and it can take a long time for average students to grasp new domain information. These average students want to be spoon-fed, which is a major criticism that businesses have of new graduates.",

This is also a critical skill for their future careers for project handovers and maintenance work, which many students do not have experience with. As discussed earlier, the students and look at the wiki that shows what the previous students have done, and I also talk to them over the phone about the work of the previous students. This should not be a surprise to applicants that they are working on a project developed by previous interns. They can refuse the offer of the project if they find the project not to their liking. The current intake of the Genomics Metadata Multiplexing project is an example of an ongoing project that is working extremely well due to the foundational work done by previous students.

        "content": "Other Interactions I also have scheduled a voluntary follow-up session / networking session between students on Thursday across the entire student intake but have stopped these due to lack of uptake by the students. By the third week no-one attends, and I am left to myself. I also have added to the handbook and onboarding checklist the monthly in-person Research Software Engineer (RSE) lunches that I organise and attend but again, the uptake has been low. Roughly, less than 5% of students attend a lunch and none attend consistently. Last intake, I asked a group of students to liaise with another group on a project. I asked multiple times but this was not actioned. This intake, I did ask for more structure where a scheduled meeting with a sister project needed to be set and this has increased the communication between groups. In the projects where there is a need for a Subject Matter Expert (SME), I have been trialling to catchup with the SME at the 5-week mark for a Q and A. This allows the students to understand the information in the wiki and some basic terms and models of the domain so that they can make the most out of the SME\u2019s time and answers. This has been a good working model so far. I go into the office once a month, mainly for the RSE lunches. I have worked at WEHI for over 3 years now and have had an in-person meeting with my supervisor once. I am basically a remote worker. So, to increase the opportunity of in-person meetups, I have tried to get students to meet me in-person as part of the RSE lunches, but there has been little uptake. I tried to organise an in-person tour of the WEHI building last year after some questions from students, but no students responded to the email. There used to be a weekly tour of the WEHI building but this been cancelled since the pandemic. I also emailed students about an in-person student intern conference that WEHI runs every year where they could present and meet fellow student interns, but no one responded. To ensure students are aware that this is 100% remote I have updated the website and I have amended the application form to now ask them to confirm that they know that this is a 100% remote internship as appears below: I recognise that this is a 100% remote role and that all meetings and interactions will be virtual. I also recognise that there are opportunities for in-person events like the monthly Parkville Research Software Engineer lunch.",

These tags are read out via next generation sequencing and help to study important questions in biology like cancer evolution or embryonic development. Given that both the technology and the data it generates are new, no software is currently available that would facilitate the analysis, especially for experimental researchers less familiar with programming and computation.

        "content": "Introduction Post-sequencing quality control (QC) is an important step in ensuring that the quality of sequencing data meets expectations. Multiple tools exist to evaluate sequencing quality, such as FastQC[1], Fastq Screen[2] and Qualimap[3]. Core sequencing facilities, such as WEHI Genomics, process hundreds of sequencing runs every year. In order to troubleshoot sequencing issues and provide assurance of data quality to collaborators, sequencing facilities must implement robust data management workflows to ensure that QC data processing is automated where possible, is easily accessible and is appropriately archived for posterity. Given a large volume of runs, there exists the possibility of inter-run QC comparisons to better gauge run quality. MultiQC[4] is a software tool that collates and displays QC information from numerous supported bioinformatics tools. MultiQC operates on a per-run basis, however, MegaQC[5] collates the data from these reports for comparison. However, MegaQC has not been in active development since 2020 and is considered \u201cpretty unstable\u201d by the developers. Additionally, the software lacks functionality that lists extensive project metadata, so that experiments can be more easily tracked and MultiQC reports can be easily located. Lastly, the tool lacks easy exporting of data, so that analyses can be further analysed programmatically. Given that MegaQC overlaps with many of our use cases, it may be possible to modify and/or extend the software for our use cases. Alternatively, Shiny apps (shiny.rstudio.com) allow for interactive data analysis and provide an ideal platform for QC data collation. Integration with Monday.com and LabArchives used by the Genomics lab may also be of benefit for retrieving and/or depositing QC data and project metadata.

It plays a critical role in helping researchers by providing an extensive and comprehensive ecosystem of software tools, packages, and resources tailored specifically for the analysis and interpretation of high-throughput biological data. Visualizations, especially visualizations of dimension reductions, are the workhorse of all scRNA-seq data analyses. They are hugely important during all stages of analysis, from exploring to presenting results. They often shape analysis decisions, like which batch correction approach to use, and can point to novel discoveries, like novel cell type marker genes or even new cell types. Unfortunately, currently employed visualization strategies struggle with the scale and sparsity of scRNA-seq data, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Overplotting is not a new problem and it has plagued many different fields, many of which have come up with unique solutions. Here, we suggest the use of hexagonal binning (Carr, 1990; Carr et al., 1987) for dimension reduction representations of scRNA-seq data. In order to make hexagonal plotting readily available to the scientific community, we developed schex (single-cell hexagonal plotting), an R package that allows users to produce hexagonal binning representations for dimension reductions of scRNA-seq. However, maintaining research software and making it easy to use can be difficult for researchers in the long run. This project is to aim at finding out which areas of software maintenance can possibly abstracted away from the researcher and into the hands of a Research Software Engineer (RSE).",

Data integration enables identification of specific biological relationships between these features (e.g. genes and proteins), to create new insights into molecular processes involved in health and disease. MixOmics includes 19 data integration methods, amongst which 13 were developed in our lab. These methods are all based on dimension reduction using Projection to Latent Structures (PLS). Our users include computational biologists, molecular biologists and bioinformaticians who wish to integrate their data and identify signatures of genes, proteins etc. to explain or predict a disease outcome. The package (ranked in the top 5% package in Bioconductor) is easy to use because all methods use the same underlying PLS principles and produce numerous graphics for interpretation (Fig. 1).

This is a type of metadata. While this allows the sequencing facility to save money by processing samples in bulk, the ability to keep track of these multiplexes is complicated. This is especially significant because there is no resourcing to provide an assistant to be able to check the quality all the metadata at the time of multiplexing.

        "content": "Introduction Our cells contain a vast array of interacting organelles (tiny structures within cells that perform specific tasks, similar to the parts of a machine) that determine cellular processes through both health and disease. These structures may be imaged using electron microscopy by bouncing electrons off heavy-metal stained membranes. The resulting images have a resolution of nanometers per voxel (the 3D equivalent of an image pixel) in 3D and each data set may contain millions or billions of voxels per cell. [1] In a paper from 2021 [2] a new method for processing images from the focused ion beam-scanning EM (FIB-SEM) was used to image the cellular ultrastructure of phagophore-ER contacts in three dimensions. As per the paper: FIB-SEM is ideally suited for the acquisition of 3D ultrastructural images from large cellular volumes (Hoffman et al., 2020). However, traditional methods for the reconstruction and analysis of such data require manual image segmentation and classification. The hand-drawn surfaces that are generated during manual segmentation are laborious to produce, low throughput, and subject to human imprecision, making them unsuitable for large-scale morphometric analyses. To overcome these limitations, we developed an approach that delegates the most time-consuming tasks to an artificial intelligence (AI) within a framework that captures the true surface detail of intracellular organelles. Using the machine learning capabilities of Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) in combination with ImageJ (Arganda-Carreras et al., 2017; Frank et al., 2004; Schindelin et al., 2012), we trained a random forest computer vision model to faithfully detect all cellular membranes in volumetric FIB-SEM data (Figures 6A and 6B). We have termed this 3D framework AIVE (AI-directed voxel extraction; workflow outlined in Figure S7). The project would involve a series of stages to bring the software infrastructure to a level that will help with development. The initial stage would involve the setup of the workflow along with testing and improving the documentation of the workflow on a local laptop. The potential second stage would be to aim to run the workflow in the WEHI HPC environment known as Milton. The potential third stage would be to add more data to test the workflow to ensure that the test coverage is broader than it is currently. Once this third stage is achieved, there will be an opportunity to work on streamlining the AIVE workflow.

The public wiki is to share information with future students the things you needed to understand at a high level to be able to start working on the technical side of the project. General knowledge to put into the wiki would include (among others): A diagram showing how the high-level parts of the system interact A diagram of how the biology works at a simple level that you need for the project A diagram to show how the overall steps of the workflow and a simple explanation of why each step is done NOTE: Please ensure that anything you put in the public domain is not private. The rule of thumb is that if you found the material on the public internet, you can treat it as public. If you found the material within WEHI or from a WEHI source, you should ask if you can make it public. If you are not sure, please ask your supervisor.",

Technical knowledge to put into your technical diary in Sharepoint (among others) would include: URLs of any documents you read or videos you watch, along with a quick summary of those documents to make it easy for others to decide if these documents or videos are worth reading/watching. commandline commands you used to setup your sofwtware system eg. pip install pandas technical errors you encountered and how you fixed them, or what was the process you found to fix them general technical notes that took you some time to figure out that might help a future student any technical help you received from other students, mentors, or supervisors",

If it is a broad question, did you do an internet search? Did you ask your project teammates to help you? That is what team mates are for! Did you write down in the email what actions you took in steps #2 and #3 so I know what you have tried? Did you specify exactly what you are having a problem with? ie. \u201cI had trouble with a document\u201d vs \u201cI had trouble accessing ABC.doc in Sharepoint folder X\u201d. Did you cc in your team mates into the email so that they can find out too? Please also make sure you explain the problem in detail, with screenshots and any error messages .

During the time away there is no need to write and send the weekly update email during the break. We do encourage you to write down questions and what you have done in your technical diary so that you can ask questions when we are back in the second week of January. Remember, we ask you to write up a presentation to say what you think you should do on the project. This helps you become independent. If you do decide to do some work over the holidays, understanding the high level problem will help you make decisions at a technical level without your supervisor\u2019s help.

They are usually done at the same time as the regular weekly project meeting. It is important to provide an early draft and a late draft to your supervisors for both the final presentation and the summary report. The early draft is to make sure you are on the right track, and the late draft is to polish things. Please put them into Teams Files / Sharepoint so that they can be commented on directly by your supervisors. We create a single document for all summary reports to be filed together. You will be sent a link to this document when it is ready. The one page project summary audience is for myself and potential researchers who want to understand what you have done from a high level point of view, but can easily click on links to get to the technical detail / reports / visualisations. The one page summary should be handed in before the presentation or before the internship finishes. For your final presentation \u2013 please make sure you have an acknowledgement slide and show the slides to your supervisor before your final presentation. A good example of a set of slides is here. And here is another final student presentation example, although it is a little long. . The audience for the presentation is for future students and for researchers who might be interested in understanding what you have done from a high level point of view, but can easily look at the wiki to find out more.
